# oneapm-loopback-testcase

This repo works as a testcase of OneAPM Ai agent in Loopback framework.

1. `npm run test` will run the simplest test case to make the issue reappear
2. `npm run dev` will start the application and reload it when source files changed
3. A JSON file `./db.memory.json` will be created/updated automatically for data inspection
